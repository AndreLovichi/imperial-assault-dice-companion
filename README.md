# Imperial Assault Dice Companion

A pet project to compute basic statistics on dice rolls for the board game Imperial Assault.

The app is available at [andrelovichi.info/imperial-assault](https://andrelovichi.info/imperial-assault/), and is designed for desktop and mobile users.

Feel free to use it, and may the Force (and the white dice) be with you!
